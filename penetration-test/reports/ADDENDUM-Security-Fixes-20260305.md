## Detailed Remediation Actions

### 1. Security Headers Implementation

**Finding:** Multiple OWASP-recommended security headers were missing from HTTP responses:
- X-Frame-Options (clickjacking protection)
- X-Content-Type-Options (MIME sniffing protection)
- Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS - force HTTPS)
- Content-Security-Policy (XSS/data injection protection)
- Referrer-Policy (privacy protection)
- Permissions-Policy (feature access control)

**Risk:**
- Clickjacking attacks possible via iframe embedding
- MIME sniffing attacks could execute malicious content
- SSL stripping attacks possible without HSTS
- XSS and data injection via inline scripts/styles
- Privacy leakage via referrer headers

**Remediation:**

Created Kubernetes Middleware resource `traefik-security-headers` in the `traefik` namespace with the following configuration:

```yaml
apiVersion: traefik.io/v1alpha1
kind: Middleware
metadata:
  name: security-headers
  namespace: traefik
spec:
  headers:
    customFrameOptionsValue: "SAMEORIGIN"
    contentTypeNosniff: true
    browserXssFilter: true
    referrerPolicy: "strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
    stsSeconds: 31536000
    stsIncludeSubdomains: true
    stsPreload: true
    contentSecurityPolicy: "default-src 'self'; ..."
```

Applied headers:
| Header | Value | Purpose |
|--------|-------|---------|
| X-Frame-Options | SAMEORIGIN | Prevents clickjacking |
| X-Content-Type-Options | nosniff | Prevents MIME sniffing |
| X-XSS-Protection | 1; mode=block | Legacy XSS filter |
| Strict-Transport-Security | max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload | Forces HTTPS for 1 year |
| Content-Security-Policy | default-src 'self'... | Controls resource loading |
| Referrer-Policy | strict-origin-when-cross-origin | Privacy protection |
| Permissions-Policy | feature restrictions | Limits browser API access |

**Files Modified:**
- `deployments/dev-cluster/1-infrastructure/main.tf`
  - Added `kubernetes_manifest.traefik_security_headers` resource
  - Added middleware reference in Traefik Helm values

**Deployment Required:**

The security headers middleware is deployed via Terraform in the 1-infrastructure stage.

**No new variables required** - uses existing terraform.tfvars configuration. No changes to any variable values needed.

```bash
# Ensure kubectl is configured for the cluster
kubectl config use-context dev-rke2

# Apply security headers middleware
cd deployments/dev-cluster/1-infrastructure
# No terraform.tfvars changes required - just re-apply
terraform init
terraform apply
```

**What this deploys:**
- Creates `traefik-security-headers` Middleware resource in the traefik namespace
- Configures Traefik to apply headers to all websecure (HTTPS) entrypoints
- Headers are applied globally to all services behind Traefik

---

### 2. Server Version Disclosure

**Finding:** Server header disclosed nginx version: `nginx/1.25.5`

**Risk:** Version information aids attackers in identifying known vulnerabilities for the specific software version.

**Remediation:**

Added `server_tokens off;` directive to nginx configuration in the nginx-sample module.

**Files Modified:**
- `deployments/modules/nginx-sample/config/default.conf`
  - Added `server_tokens off;` at server block level

**Result:** Nginx will now respond with generic `Server: nginx` header without version information.

**Deployment Required:**

The nginx configuration change requires redeploying the 2-applications stage.

**No new variables required** - uses existing terraform.tfvars configuration. No changes to any variable values needed.

```bash
# Ensure kubectl context is set
kubectl config use-context dev-rke2

# Apply nginx configuration changes
cd deployments/dev-cluster/2-applications
# No terraform.tfvars changes required - just re-apply
terraform apply
```

**Note:** This will trigger a rolling update of the nginx deployment with `server_tokens off;` added to hide the version.

---

### Full Redeployment (If Needed)

If you need to fully rebuild from scratch with all security fixes:

```bash
# 1. Setup SSH keys (Step 2 from README)
export AWS_ACCOUNT_ID=364082771643
./scripts/create-openvpn-ssh-key.sh
./scripts/create-rke-ssh-key.sh

# 2. Deploy 1-infrastructure (includes security headers)
cd deployments/dev-cluster/1-infrastructure
terraform apply

# 3. Deploy 2-applications (includes nginx with server_tokens off)
cd ../2-applications
terraform apply

# 4. Verify deployment
kubectl get middleware -n traefik security-headers
kubectl get pods -n nginx-sample
```

---

## Post-Remediation Verification

### Expected Results After Deployment

| Test Category | Expected Result |
|---------------|-----------------|
| Security Headers | All 7 headers present with correct values |
| Server Banner | `Server: nginx` (no version) |
| Clickjacking | Protected via X-Frame-Options |
| MIME Sniffing | Protected via X-Content-Type-Options |
| HTTPS Enforcement | HSTS active (1 year, includeSubDomains, preload) |
| XSS Protection | CSP + X-XSS-Protection active |

### Verification Commands

After deployment completes, verify the fixes are active:

```bash
# 1. Check that security headers middleware exists
kubectl get middleware -n traefik security-headers -o yaml

# 2. Check headers are present in responses
curl -sI https://nginx.dev.foobar.support | grep -E "^X-|Content-Security|Strict-Transport|Referrer|Permissions"

# Expected output:
# X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
# X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
# X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
# Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload
# Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self' ...
# Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
# Permissions-Policy: accelerometer=(), camera=() ...

# 3. Check server banner (should show no version)
curl -sI https://nginx.dev.foobar.support | grep -i server
# Expected: server: nginx (no version number)

# 4. Run full penetration test suite
cd penetration-test
export TARGET_URL=https://nginx.dev.foobar.support
./run-all-tests.sh

# 5. Check Traefik logs for middleware application
kubectl logs -n traefik deployment/traefik | grep -i "security\|middleware"
```

### Expected Post-Deployment Results

| Test | Expected Result |
|------|-----------------|
| `test-headers.sh` | All 7 security headers present |
| `test-tls.sh` | TLS 1.2/1.3 supported, certificate valid |
| `test-info-disclosure.sh` | Server version hidden, no exposed paths |
| `test-attack-vectors.sh` | XSS protected, clickjacking protected |
| `test-rate-limiting.sh` | Rate limiting at infrastructure level |

### Troubleshooting

**Issue:** Headers not appearing in responses
- Verify middleware is created: `kubectl get middleware -n traefik`
- Check Traefik logs: `kubectl logs -n traefik deployment/traefik`
- Ensure terraform apply completed successfully in 1-infrastructure

**Issue:** Server version still showing
- Verify 2-applications was redeployed after config change
- Check nginx pod was restarted: `kubectl get pods -n nginx-sample`
- Force rollout: `kubectl rollout restart deployment/nginx-sample -n nginx-sample`

---

## Remaining Recommendations

While all critical issues have been resolved, the following enhancements are recommended for continuous security improvement:

### Short-Term (30-90 days)

1. **CSP Reporting**
   - Add CSP report-uri endpoint to collect policy violations
   - Monitor for legitimate resources being blocked
   - Tune CSP policy based on actual application needs

2. **HSTS Preloading**
   - Submit domain to hstspreload.org after HSTS is stable
   - Ensure all subdomains serve HTTPS before preload

3. **Certificate Transparency Monitoring**
   - Monitor CT logs for unauthorized certificate issuance
   - Set up alerts for unexpected certificate changes

### Long-Term (90+ days)

1. **WAF Evaluation**
   - Consider AWS WAF for additional attack pattern protection
   - Implement rate limiting rules at WAF level

2. **Security Automation**
   - Integrate penetration tests into CI/CD pipeline
   - Automated daily security header validation
   - Weekly vulnerability scanning

3. **Zero Trust Architecture**
   - Evaluate mutual TLS (mTLS) for internal service communication
   - Implement service mesh for enhanced security controls
