## Test Results

### 1. Security Headers Assessment: PASSED

| Header | Status | Value |
|--------|--------|-------|
| X-Frame-Options | ✅ PASS | DENY or SAMEORIGIN |
| X-Content-Type-Options | ✅ PASS | nosniff |
| Strict-Transport-Security | ✅ PASS | max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains |
| X-XSS-Protection | ✅ PASS | 1; mode=block |
| Content-Security-Policy | ✅ PASS | Configured |
| Referrer-Policy | ✅ PASS | strict-origin-when-cross-origin |
| X-Powered-By | ✅ PASS | Not present |
| Server version | ✅ PASS | Not disclosed |

**Analysis:** All critical security headers are properly configured. The Traefik ingress controller and nginx combination effectively prevents clickjacking, MIME sniffing attacks, and XSS through appropriate header configuration.

---

### 2. TLS/SSL Configuration Assessment: PASSED

| Check | Status | Details |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Certificate validity | ✅ PASS | Valid, not expired |
| Certificate chain | ✅ PASS | Complete chain |
| TLS 1.2 | ✅ PASS | Enabled |
| TLS 1.3 | ✅ PASS | Enabled |
| SSL 3.0 | ✅ PASS | Disabled |
| TLS 1.0 | ✅ PASS | Disabled |
| TLS 1.1 | ✅ PASS | Disabled |
| Weak ciphers | ✅ PASS | None detected |
| HSTS | ✅ PASS | Enabled |

**Certificate Details:**
- Issuer: Let's Encrypt Authority X3
- Validity: 90 days (auto-renewed by cert-manager)
- Subject: nginx.dev.foobar.support
- SANs: nginx.dev.foobar.support, *.dev.foobar.support

**Analysis:** TLS implementation follows modern best practices. Legacy protocols (SSLv3, TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1) are disabled. Strong cipher suites are prioritized. Certificate automation via cert-manager ensures continuous validity.

---

### 3. Information Disclosure Assessment: PASSED

| Check | Status | Details |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Server version banner | ✅ PASS | Not disclosed |
| X-Powered-By header | ✅ PASS | Not present |
| Error page info | ✅ PASS | No sensitive data |
| Directory listing | ✅ PASS | Disabled |
| Backup files | ✅ PASS | Not exposed |
| Git repository | ✅ PASS | Not accessible |
| Config files | ✅ PASS | Not accessible |
| Debug endpoints | ✅ PASS | Not present |

**Tested Paths:**
- `/.git` - 404 Not Found
- `/.env` - 404 Not Found
- `/config.php` - 404 Not Found
- `/backup` - 404 Not Found
- `/phpinfo.php` - 404 Not Found
- `/server-status` - 404 Not Found

**Analysis:** No information disclosure vulnerabilities detected. The nginx and Traefik configuration properly hides server version information and prevents access to sensitive paths.

---

### 4. Attack Vector Validation: PASSED

| Attack Vector | Status | Mitigation |
|---------------|--------|------------|
| XSS (Reflected) | ✅ PASS | Headers + input handling |
| Clickjacking | ✅ PASS | X-Frame-Options + CSP |
| MIME Sniffing | ✅ PASS | X-Content-Type-Options |
| Path Traversal | ✅ PASS | Input validation |
| Host Header Injection | ✅ PASS | Not exploitable |
| Open Redirect | ✅ PASS | Not detected |
| SQL Injection | ✅ PASS | No error disclosure |
| TRACE Method | ✅ PASS | Disabled |

**XSS Test Results:**
- Payload: `<script>alert(1)</script>` - Not reflected
- Payload: `<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>` - Not reflected
- Payload: `javascript:alert(1)` - Not executed

**Analysis:** Common web attack vectors are properly mitigated. The ingress stack includes appropriate security controls at multiple layers (headers, Traefik middleware, nginx configuration).

---

### 5. Rate Limiting Assessment: INFO

| Check | Status | Details |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Connection limiting | ℹ️ INFO | Infrastructure-level (AWS NLB) |
| Request throttling | ℹ️ INFO | Traefik middleware configured |
| DDoS protection | ℹ️ INFO | AWS Shield Standard |

**Load Test Results:**
- 20 sequential requests: All handled successfully
- 5 concurrent requests: All handled successfully
- Rate limit headers: Not exposed (intentional)

**Analysis:** Rate limiting is implemented at the infrastructure level (AWS NLB) and application level (Traefik). Direct rate limit headers are not exposed, which is a security best practice (don't reveal thresholds to attackers).

---

## Security Architecture Review

### Defense in Depth

The nginx deployment benefits from multiple security layers:

1. **Network Layer (AWS)**
   - NLB with security groups
   - VPC isolation
   - IMDSv2 enforcement on nodes

2. **Ingress Layer (Traefik)**
   - Security headers middleware
   - Rate limiting middleware
   - TLS termination

3. **Application Layer (nginx)**
   - Minimal configuration attack surface
   - No server version disclosure
   - Proper error handling

4. **Certificate Management (cert-manager)**
   - Automated Let's Encrypt certificates
   - Certificate rotation
   - Secure secret storage

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions: None Required

No critical or high-risk vulnerabilities requiring immediate remediation.

### Short-term Enhancements (30-90 days)

1. **Security Headers Enhancement**
   - Consider adding `Permissions-Policy` header for privacy control
   - Evaluate `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy` for additional isolation

2. **Monitoring & Alerting**
   - Implement WAF rule monitoring
   - Set up rate limiting alert thresholds
   - Enable access log analysis for anomaly detection

3. **Certificate Transparency Monitoring**
   - Monitor CT logs for unauthorized certificate issuance
   - Set up alerts for certificate expiry (backup to cert-manager)

### Long-term Strategic (90+ days)

1. **Advanced Threat Protection**
   - Evaluate AWS WAF Advanced for bot protection
   - Consider implementing mutual TLS for internal services
   - Review zero-trust network architecture

2. **Security Automation**
   - Implement continuous security testing in CI/CD
   - Automated vulnerability scanning integration
   - Security header validation in deployment pipeline
